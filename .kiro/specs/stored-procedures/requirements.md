# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for implementing stored procedures in the CCICT Helpdesk application to enhance security, maintainability, and performance. Stored procedures will encapsulate database logic, provide better access control, and reduce SQL injection risks by moving complex queries from the application layer to the database layer.

## Glossary

- **Helpdesk_System**: The CCICT Helpdesk web application for managing student support tickets
- **Stored_Procedure**: A precompiled SQL code block stored in the database that can be executed by name
- **Role_Based_Access**: Database-level permissions that restrict operations based on user roles (admin vs support)
- **Ticket_Entity**: A support request record containing student information and issue details
- **Audit_Trail**: A log of all changes made to tickets for compliance and tracking
- **Parameterized_Query**: A query that uses placeholders for values to prevent SQL injection

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Ticket Management Operations

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want secure stored procedures for ticket operations, so that database logic is centralized and protected from SQL injection attacks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin creates a ticket, THE Helpdesk_System SHALL execute a stored procedure that validates student_id existence and inserts the ticket record
2. WHEN an admin updates a ticket status to resolved, THE Helpdesk_System SHALL execute a stored procedure that updates the status field and records the change in the audit trail
3. WHEN an admin deletes a ticket, THE Helpdesk_System SHALL execute a stored procedure that removes the ticket and logs the deletion in the audit trail
4. THE Helpdesk_System SHALL ensure all ticket stored procedures validate input parameters before execution
5. THE Helpdesk_System SHALL return meaningful error codes when stored procedure operations fail

### Requirement 2: Student Data Retrieval with Role-Based Access

**User Story:** As a support user, I want to retrieve student data through stored procedures, so that phone number visibility is enforced at the database level based on my role.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a support user retrieves student records, THE Helpdesk_System SHALL execute a stored procedure that returns student data with phone numbers masked
2. WHEN an admin user retrieves student records, THE Helpdesk_System SHALL execute a stored procedure that returns complete student data including phone numbers
3. THE Helpdesk_System SHALL implement role detection within stored procedures using PostgreSQL session variables or parameters
4. THE Helpdesk_System SHALL ensure stored procedures validate the caller's role before returning sensitive data
5. WHERE a user attempts to access data beyond their role permissions, THE Helpdesk_System SHALL return an access denied error

### Requirement 3: Dashboard Statistics Aggregation

**User Story:** As an admin or support user, I want dashboard statistics calculated through stored procedures, so that complex aggregations are performed efficiently at the database level.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin views the dashboard, THE Helpdesk_System SHALL execute a stored procedure that returns total students, total tickets, total staff, and last ticket timestamp in a single call
2. WHEN a support user views the dashboard, THE Helpdesk_System SHALL execute a stored procedure that returns open ticket count, resolved ticket count, and total students in a single call
3. THE Helpdesk_System SHALL ensure dashboard stored procedures use optimized queries with appropriate indexes
4. THE Helpdesk_System SHALL complete dashboard stored procedure execution within 500 milliseconds for datasets up to 10,000 records
5. THE Helpdesk_System SHALL return statistics in a structured format that the application can parse without additional processing

### Requirement 4: Audit Log Retrieval and Filtering

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want to retrieve audit logs through stored procedures with filtering options, so that I can efficiently search historical changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin retrieves audit logs, THE Helpdesk_System SHALL execute a stored procedure that returns logs ordered by timestamp descending
2. WHERE an admin specifies a date range filter, THE Helpdesk_System SHALL execute a stored procedure that returns only logs within that range
3. WHERE an admin specifies an action type filter, THE Helpdesk_System SHALL execute a stored procedure that returns only logs matching that action type
4. WHERE an admin specifies a student ID filter, THE Helpdesk_System SHALL execute a stored procedure that returns only logs for that student
5. THE Helpdesk_System SHALL ensure audit log stored procedures support pagination with offset and limit parameters

### Requirement 5: Authentication and User Management

**User Story:** As a staff user, I want authentication handled through stored procedures, so that password verification and user validation are performed securely at the database level.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a staff user attempts to login, THE Helpdesk_System SHALL execute a stored procedure that validates username and returns user details if credentials are valid
2. THE Helpdesk_System SHALL ensure the authentication stored procedure does not return password hashes to the application layer
3. WHEN a staff user's password needs updating, THE Helpdesk_System SHALL execute a stored procedure that updates the password hash with proper bcrypt validation
4. THE Helpdesk_System SHALL implement stored procedures that prevent timing attacks by using constant-time comparison operations
5. WHERE invalid credentials are provided, THE Helpdesk_System SHALL return a generic authentication failure message without revealing whether username or password was incorrect

### Requirement 6: Ticket Search and Filtering

**User Story:** As an admin or support user, I want to search tickets through stored procedures, so that search operations are optimized and protected from SQL injection.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user searches tickets by issue text, THE Helpdesk_System SHALL execute a stored procedure that performs case-insensitive pattern matching
2. WHERE a user filters tickets by status, THE Helpdesk_System SHALL execute a stored procedure that returns only tickets matching the specified status
3. WHERE a user filters tickets by student name, THE Helpdesk_System SHALL execute a stored procedure that performs a join with the students table and filters results
4. THE Helpdesk_System SHALL ensure search stored procedures use full-text search indexes where appropriate for performance
5. THE Helpdesk_System SHALL limit search results to 100 records per query to prevent performance degradation

### Requirement 7: Batch Operations for Ticket Management

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want to perform batch operations on tickets through stored procedures, so that multiple tickets can be updated efficiently in a single transaction.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin resolves multiple tickets, THE Helpdesk_System SHALL execute a stored procedure that updates all specified ticket IDs in a single transaction
2. WHEN an admin deletes multiple tickets, THE Helpdesk_System SHALL execute a stored procedure that removes all specified tickets and logs each deletion
3. THE Helpdesk_System SHALL ensure batch stored procedures validate all ticket IDs exist before performing any operations
4. WHERE any ticket ID in a batch operation is invalid, THE Helpdesk_System SHALL rollback the entire transaction and return an error
5. THE Helpdesk_System SHALL ensure batch operations complete within 2 seconds for up to 50 tickets

### Requirement 8: Data Validation and Integrity

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating a ticket, THE Helpdesk_System SHALL execute a stored procedure that validates the student_id references an existing student
2. WHEN creating a ticket, THE Helpdesk_System SHALL execute a stored procedure that validates the issue text is not empty and does not exceed 5000 characters
3. WHEN updating a ticket status, THE Helpdesk_System SHALL execute a stored procedure that validates the status value is either 'open' or 'resolved'
4. WHERE validation fails, THE Helpdesk_System SHALL return a specific error code and message indicating which validation rule was violated
